Photoshop CS6: Batch Processing Watermarks on Multiple Images
To watermark multiple images we are going to record an action to watermark an image and then all we need to do is play it as a batch process.

Recording the action:
Open an image to watermark. We must have this open before we start recording an action or else it will keep opening this image and watermarking it over and over again.
In Photoshop go to Windows >> Actions
At the bottom of the Actions Palette you will see a little folder icon, click on it and create a new folder to hold you action in.
Once you have a folder to hold your action we need to hit the Create New Action button (next to the new folder Icon we just used.)
Give our new action a name and set a function key (if required.)
If the record button is not already depressed which it should be by default, hit it now to start recording our action. (located near the folder icon again but this time to the left)
Now that our action is recording go to File >> Place
When the dialog box comes up navigate to your previously created watermark file.
Hit the Place button
Position the watermark as you would normally have it (default is dead center) and hit enter.
Go to File >> Save as,navigate to where you want your watermarked images to finish up and hit save. DO NOT CHANGE THE FILE NAME if you do when you play the batch it will name all the files it saves with this same file name so each image in the batch will over-write the previous image in the batch.
Close the image we just watermarked.
when a save dialog comes up do not save the image.
On the Actions Palette hit stop recording.
Our Action is now recorded.
To process an entire folder of images we go to File >> Automate >> Batch
Select the folder in which your images are currently
Select the folder you wish to save the watermarked copies too.
Hit OK
Photoshop CS6 is now watermarking all the Images in the selected folder for you.
